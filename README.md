# twitter->AWS Airflow project
This project aims to get data from an API response and store it  in AWS S3 bucket.
The DAG runs on an EC2 instance , nothing local!
Idea is to use this to extract tradinng market data based on certain keywords (WIP) and get Sentiment Analysis extracted.
Future Work:
This will be used to manually tweak pyIntradayTrader bot's scope
